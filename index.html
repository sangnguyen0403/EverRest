                    <p>I've been working in HCM for 19 years. I am proficient in both Vietnamese and English. I had an interest in the data field when I had a chance to visit a workshop on careers in the data field. I'm fascinated by how people in the data industry can develop meaningful insights by analyzing datasets or how they can make actionable strategies for their company or organization by interpreting the results of data analysis, processing, and modeling. Throughout my RMIT learning journey. I've built up my skills in C++, Java, Python, and SQL. In addition to technical skills, I have experience in cleansing, modeling and visualizing data to provide insights. I am also self-learning R programming, Alteryx and Machine Learning models.</p>

                    <h5>s3872140</h5>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. At the age of 15 years old, I had a chance to go abroad to the United States of America, and now I’m studying at RMIT which reflects the Australian education system. I’m not saying that I have experienced all of the education system well, but I do know the difference between them and I believe that I can choose what’s best for me in studying. The reason why I chose RMIT and IT as my major is because of my mom’s will. However, I like it here and I like IT genuinely. Even though I have to admit that IT is a hard major, I don’t think it would be any easier if I chose another major. After 1 year studying in Software Engineering and recently moving to IT, I have experience in C, C++, Java, SQL, Python, and on-going Linux coding languages. I’m still learning and improving myself day by day and I believe that I can be better anytime as long as I’m trying my best.

                    <h5>s3956092</h5>
                    <p>Just like most RMIT students, I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city or Saigon. As a Vietnamese who studied at public schools for 12 years, l felt quite lost and confused when I was “forced” to choose a career that I would potentially study and work for years. So, my first choice was finance which I obviously wasn’t so intrigued and excited about. Not wanting to waste my years studying something that doesn’t excite me, I start to ask myself what I’m actually interested in besides all the things that I learn in school. That is when I realized that I have been curious about technology and how programmes work. The fact that humans are able to create those from dirt and soils weirds me out and makes me want to learn more about it at the same time. However I’m brand new to IT meaning that sometimes the work gets hard and confusing. But for sure, I will try my best learning new knowledge and skills for this field such as Python, MySQL, and Linux to constantly improve myself.</p>

                    <p>I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city which is in the south of Vietnam. Fortunately, I have studied in an International school since primary school until the end of high school, so I can speak quite fluently English. School is not the only thing that helps me to learn English well, but also games have taught me many new words. Therefore, it is my favorite hobby, but it also leads me to troubles because I spend lots of time on it. However, it is the reason why I choose to study IT to support my future job which is Game Development. Before this first semester, I have finished studying C Programming and have a little bit of experience about Java. Moreover, during this course, I have learned some basic information about Python and SQL. In the IT field only, I do not know many things yet, but I will try to figure out and learn more new knowledge.</p>

                    <p>Overall, our team worked effectively together and completed all of the allocated tasks with great quality. We communicated mostly through Messenger and Canvas, with a face-to-face meeting once a week to discuss the project, report, and review our work. Even though we experienced some issues with one of our teammates at first, we were able to complete our assignment. Fortunately, each member of the group respects one another and is eager to put in their all for this project. They also recommended some great suggestions to improve our project so that we could complete it without difficulty. Our team also makes make sure jobs are assigned fairly so that each member of the group contributes equally. This adventure with my team is quite enjoyable for me.</p>

                    <p>Having teammates in the same tutorial group is the biggest advantage for us. Despite the fact that we still have online lectures, offline tutorial lessons are the best way to meet and hold our weekly meetings. Before meeting each other, we had already talked through our Facebook Messenger group chat. Luckily, all of us were comfortable among each other so there was no awkwardness. Another helpful that we used during our project was the Groups section on Canvas. We used this section to upload every summary of our meetings, the tasks, the deadlines, and meeting notes. This helps us to keep track of the time we have left and the current process of our project. Even though our early process had a teammate problem, we managed to figure everything out together and had come to a decision where our team would just consist of 4 members. Remarkably, we weren’t rushed by our deadlines since we started working on it so early. We divided our tasks equally and fairly based on our skills and strengths. In conclusion, I believe we did a splendid job and we deserve a score worth our hard work.</p>

                    <p>As a freshman, I was feeling a bit nervous when it came to working as a group since it is my first time doing so in a university environment. However, my teammates are really talented, cooperative, and supportive which I’m grateful for. They always offer me help and suggestions whenever a problem comes up in the way so that I can complete my tasks effortlessly. Unfortunately, our team had a problem reaching out to one of the members. After giving them some time and not getting any responses, our leaders had to make a decision which is to report them to the lecturer. As a result, that person is now no longer working with us. Except for that issue, the four of us have been doing our jobs, supporting each other and working as a team smoothly and efficiently for five weeks now.</p>

                    <p>First of all, our group has been working together for more than 4 weeks. It seems like until now we have not had any problems. Everybody is working on their part really well. However, at the beginning, there was an issue with a member who was not responding, but then our group solved it smoothly. Everyone in the group is kind, respectful, and ready to help each other. Due to the fact that we combine between online and offline, I think it is really convenient for discussing and sharing ideas. We're almost finished with our project. I'm hoping it'll turn out fantastic after we're done.</p>

Additionally, I am going to read more books because it can give important knowledge which may help to answer some advanced questions in the test or solve complex problems in real life.
